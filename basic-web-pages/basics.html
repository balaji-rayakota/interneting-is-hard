    <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered lists)</li>
      <li>Add each list item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also, notice how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or a phrase.</p>
    <p>And sometimes you <em>need to <strong>shout</strong>.</em></p>

    <h2>Empty elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
